# Go 4 The Kill

The Serverside plugin for my [Go 4 The Kill CS:GO Mod](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-m7a9-ddRM)

Obviously missing are the web resources / backend / assets (Not going to release those)

I have stripped various things from the sourcecode (Mostly anticheat measures and backend communication) and didnt really care if it still compiles, this is purely released for educational purposes and curious minds.
